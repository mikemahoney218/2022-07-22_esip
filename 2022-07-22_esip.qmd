## New York State 2019 CLCPA:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

<br />

+ 85% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050  

+ Net zero emissions statewide by 2050

+ Lands & forests make up the difference

+ Need a way to monitor sequestration

## Modeling approach:

+ Ensemble modeling approach

<p></p>

+ Linear regression combining predictions from:

  + Random forest 

  + Gradient boosting machine

  + Support vector machine

<p></p>

+ Ensembling improves predictive accuracy, lets us try many models but present a single prediction

> The press will have you believe that machine learning can reliably predict whether you're gay, whether you'll develop psychosis, whether you’ll have a heart attack and whether you're a criminal—as well as other ambitious predictions such as when you'll die and whether your unpublished book will be a bestseller. It's all a lie. 

> Here's how the lie works. Researchers report high "accuracy," but then later reveal—buried within the details of a technical paper—that they were actually misusing the word "accuracy" to mean another measure of performance related to accuracy but in actuality not nearly as impressive.

### This is the mainstream opinion of AI and machine learning.

<br />

### How can we build back lost trust when developing AI systems that might impact people's lives?

## Only report the accuracy that matters

## Report accuracy spatially

![](hex_panel.png)


## Report accuracy across scales

```{r out.width='100%'}
dplyr::tribble(
  ~ "Scale", ~ "RMSE", ~ "MBE", ~ "R2", 
  "Plot-pixel comparison", 39.60, 1.88, 0.76,
  "8,660 ha hex", 33.27, 3.56, 0.76,
  "78,100 ha hex", 23.38, 1.64, 0.80,
  "216,500 ha hex", 21.17, 0.75, 0.81
) |> 
  kableExtra::kbl() |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

```{r out.width="100%"}

```

## Report accuracy for important subgroups

![](agreement.png)


## Report applicability domains

```{r out.width="80%"}

```

## Remaining Challenges

+ How can we tailor our assessments to be the most useful for end users?

<p></p>

+ How can we avoid overwhelming people with charts and tables when they just want a map?

> Many human behaviors defy reliable prediction. It’s like predicting the weather many weeks in advance. There's no achieving high certainty. There's no magic crystal ball. Readers at large must hone a certain vigilance: Be wary about claims of "high accuracy" in machine learning. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
